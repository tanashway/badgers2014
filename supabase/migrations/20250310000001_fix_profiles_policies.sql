  # Fix profiles table policies

  This migration:
  1. Ensures the profiles table has the correct RLS policies
  2. Adds a policy to allow new users to create their own profile
*/

-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view all profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own profile" ON profiles;

-- Create new policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view all profiles"
  ON profiles FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
  ON profiles FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile"
  ON profiles FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

-- Grant necessary permissions
GRANT ALL ON profiles TO authenticated;
